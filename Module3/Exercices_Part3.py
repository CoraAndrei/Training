# # Exercise 1 :
# # Write a while loop that adds all the numbers up to 10
# # Hint:
#
# counter = 0
# total = 0
#
# # Exercise 2 :
# # Using while loop, if statement and str() function; iterate through the list and if there is a 100,
# # print it with its index number. i.e.:
# # "There is a 100 at index no: 5"
#
# lst = [10, 99, 98, 85, 45, 59, 65, 66, 76, 12, 35, 13, 100, 80, 95]

#
# # Exercise 3 :
# # Display the numbers from 1 to 10 except 6.
# # Expected Output: 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10
#
# # Exercise 4 :
# # Use .pop to print the given list backwards

klass = ['Oana', 'Andreea', 'Lidia', 'Daniel', 'SRJ', 'Andrei P.', 'Andrei C.', 'Gogo']

# # Exercise 4.1:
# # Use .pop to the same list given at Ex5 and create a while loop to see how is paying attention in Class or not

# # Exercise 5:
# #  Using the same list as the list from the ex5 check if a certain person is 'in_class_or_not'
# # Hint: Use 'in' in order to check
