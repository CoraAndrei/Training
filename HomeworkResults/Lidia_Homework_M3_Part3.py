# # Exercise 1 :
# # Write a while loop that adds all the numbers up to 10

n = 0
while n <= 10:
    print(n)
    n += 1

# # Exercise 2 :
# # Using while loop, if statement and str() function; iterate through the list and if there is a 100,
# # print it with its index number. i.e.:
# # "There is a 100 at index no: 5"
