## Python Conditions and IF stataments
 - Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
 
 ```js
 Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
```

##
- Python if Statement Syntax:

```js
if expression
 Statement
else 
 Statement
```

##
- Python relies on indentation

```js
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```
